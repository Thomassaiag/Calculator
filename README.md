# Calculator

Context :
As part of the weekly exercices done at school.

The goal is to create a calculator (obviously ;-) ), displayed on an HTML page and able to handle basic operations.
Constraints: using bootstrap to facilitate the creation of visual elements
Final step is to be able to manage operator and parenthesis priorities
